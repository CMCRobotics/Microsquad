// Use JSSM to capture a state machine
// Collect sensor events and player events to update visualizations and scenes
// This logic needs to run in the same execution unit as AFrame for instance

// It needs node-homie to collect and handle events (or maybe just MicroSquad events ?)

// What if we want to have other data transit without involving the broker (e.g. webRTC chat or UDP updates)
